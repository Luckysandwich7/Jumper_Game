# Jumper_Game
Hangman, but with a parachute. Guess a 5 letter word by guess 1 letter a time. Get a word wrong and a part of the parachute will be lost. Guess 5 times wrong before getting the word and the stick figure dies. Get the word right it will end the game.

Code created by Ryan Alvord, Innocent Hove, Cooper Featherstone, and Njato Harizo.

Ryan created the code and classes.

Cooper edited coments, added 2 unkonwn words to the code, and attended both mettings.

Innocent added headers to the classes and to the method. Set all the class attributes to private so they are only accessible within the class
